Effective Scala with Project Euler
==================================
Solutions to Project Euler problems with explanations of the Scala implementations.
Unit tests demonstrate and benchmark the problem solving algorithms.

Goal: solve the problems efficiently, using scala effectively.
By Products:
* A library of utilities for solving mathematical problems
* Examples of the practical applications of mathematics

Solved Problems with Commentary:
--------------------------------
1-11, 13-17, 19, 20, 29, 36, 39, 45, 48

Common Library classes:
-----------------------
* Pascal's Triangle
* BigSquareRoot
* Sieve of Atkin
* Permutation Generator

Who this is for:
----------------
* Intermediate Scala users; you've read Martin Odersky's _Programming in Scala_, worked through
  the examples and are hungry for more.
* You're interested in functional programming, or looking to expand from more procedural or
  object-oriented programming paradigms.
* You may be working on your first real applications in Scala.
* You're concerned that some of Scala's syntactic sugar and conveniences may cause performance
  problems when implementing non-trivial algorithms.
* You'd like to improve your math skills and see if abstract concepts can give you practical ideas.

History:
-----------
I began working on the Project Euler problems in October 2009, with Scala 2.7 and I've updated the
code to be compliant with the 2.8.1 release.
