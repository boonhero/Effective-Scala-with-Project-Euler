Effective Scala with Project Euler
==============================
Solutions to Project Euler problems with explanations of the Scala implementations.
Unit tests demonstrate and benchmark the problem solving algorithms.

Who this is for
---------------
* You've read Martin Odersky's _Programming in Scala_ and worked through the examples, hungry for more.
* You may be working on your first real applications in Scala.
* You love functional programming.
* You're concerned that some of Scala's syntactic sugar and conveniences may cause performance
problems when implementing non-trivial algorithms.
* You'd like to improve your math skills and see if abstract concepts can give you practical ideas.

Background
----------
I began working on the Project Euler problems in October 2009, with Scala 2.7 and
I've updated the code to be compliant with the 2.8.1 release.
